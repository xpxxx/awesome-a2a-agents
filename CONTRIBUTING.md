# Contributing to Awesome A2A Agents

Help us build something amazing together!  Fix bugs, add agents, suggest improvements - whatever you bring to the table makes a difference.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Hit that "Fork" button up in the top right. This gives you your own copy to work with.

2. **Create a new branch:**  Time to branch out! Create a new branch so your changes stay separate until they're ready. Go with something descriptive like `add-new-agent` or `fix-typo`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-agent
   ```

3. **Make your changes:** Dive into the `README.md` file and make your edits. Stick to the format that's already there. When you're adding a new agent, don't forget:

    * What's the agent called? Link it to its repo.
    * What does it do? Give us the rundown.
    * Where does it belong? Put it in the right category (or make a new one if needed, but keep things alphabetical).

4. **Commit your changes:** Save your work with a commit message that tells us what you did. Keep it clear and to the point.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new XXX agent"
   ```

5. **Push your branch:** Send your branch up to your fork in the cloud.

   ```bash
   git push origin add-new-agent
   ```

6. **Create a pull request:** Back to the main repo - click "New pull request". Pick your fork and branch, then tell us what you did with a good title and description.

7. **Review and merge:** We'll take a look at what you've done. Might ask for some tweaks or have questions. Once we're happy with it, your changes go live!


## The Rules (Keep It Clean)

* **Keep it consistent:** The `README.md` has a style - follow it. Formatting, caps, punctuation - all that stuff matters.
* **A to Z order:**  Alphabetize everything within each category. Makes finding stuff way easier.
* **Double-check everything:** Make sure your info is right and links actually work. Nobody likes broken links.
* **One agent, one line:** Keep each agent on its own line. Looks cleaner that way.
* **Good descriptions:** Tell us what each agent does and why it's cool. Keep it short but informative.

Thanks for helping us build something awesome!
